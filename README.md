==================================================================

## L5.T1 Multiply (debug)

This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.

## L5.T2 Even or Odd

Create a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

## L5.T3 Sum of positive

You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

## L5.T4 Remove First and Last Character

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

## L5.T5 Return Negative

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

## L5.T6 String repeat

Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, 
and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

Examples (input -> output)
6, "I"     -> "IIIIII"
5, "Hello" -> "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

## L5.T7 Remove String Spaces

Write a function that removes the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

Examples:

Input -> Output
"8 j 8   mBliB8g  imjB8B8  jl  B" -> "8j8mBliB8gimjB8B8jlB"
"8 8 Bi fk8h B 8 BB8B B B  B888 c hl8 BhB fd" -> "88Bifk8hB8BB8BBBB888chl8BhBfd"
"8aaaaa dddd r     " -> "8aaaaaddddr"

## L5.T8 Grasshopper - Summation

Summation
Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example (Input -> Output):

2 -> 3 (1 + 2)
8 -> 36 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8)

## L5.T9 Find the smallest integer in the array

DESCRIPTION:
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345
You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

## L5.T10 Reversed Strings

Complete the solution so that it reverses the string passed into it.

'world'  =>  'dlrow'
'word'   =>  'drow'

## L5.T11 Counting sheep...

Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

[true,  true,  true,  false,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  true,  false, true,  false,
  true,  false, false, true ,
  true,  true,  true,  true ,
  false, false, true,  true]
The correct answer would be 17.

Hint: Don't forget to check for bad values like null/undefined

## L5.T12 Is n divisible by x and y?

Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.

Examples:
1) n =   3, x = 1, y = 3 =>  true because   3 is divisible by 1 and 3
2) n =  12, x = 2, y = 6 =>  true because  12 is divisible by 2 and 6
3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5

## L5.T13 Century From Year

Introduction
The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second century - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.

Task
Given a year, return the century it is in.

Examples
1705 --> 18
1900 --> 19
1601 --> 17
2000 --> 20

## L5.T14 Basic Mathematical Operations

Your task is to create a function that does four basic mathematical operations.

The function should take three arguments - operation(string/char), value1(number), value2(number).
The function should return result of numbers after applying the chosen operation.

Examples(Operator, value1, value2) --> output
('+', 4, 7) --> 11
('-', 15, 18) --> -3
('*', 5, 5) --> 25
('/', 49, 7) --> 7

## L5.T15 Beginner - Lost Without a Map

Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled.

For example:

[1, 2, 3] --> [2, 4, 6]

## L5.T16 Total amount of points

Return the number (count) of vowels in the given string.

We will consider a, e, i, o, u as vowels for this Kata (but not y).

The input string will only consist of lower case letters and/or spaces.

## L5.T17 Jenny's secret message

Jenny has written a function that returns a greeting for a user. However, she's in love with Johnny, and would like to greet him slightly different. She added a special case to her function, but she made a mistake.

Can you help her?

## L5.T18 Get the mean of an array

It's the academic year's end, fateful moment of your school report. The averages must be calculated. All the students come to you and entreat you to calculate their average for them. Easy ! You just need to write a script.

Return the average of the given array rounded down to its nearest integer.

The array will never be empty.

## L5.T19 Array plus array

I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

## L5.T20 Rock Paper Scissors!

Rock Paper Scissors
Let's play! You have to return which player won! In case of a draw return Draw!.

Examples(Input1, Input2 --> Output):

"scissors", "paper" --> "Player 1 won!"
"scissors", "rock" --> "Player 2 won!"
"paper", "paper" --> "Draw!"

## L5.T21 Is he gonna survive?

DESCRIPTION:
A hero is on his way to the castle to complete his mission. However, he's been told that the castle is surrounded with a couple of powerful dragons! each dragon takes 2 bullets to be defeated, our hero has no idea how many bullets he should carry.. Assuming he's gonna grab a specific given number of bullets and move forward to fight another specific given number of dragons, will he survive?

Return True if yes, False otherwise :)

## L5.T22 Convert a string to an array

Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.

Examples (Input ==> Output):
"Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]

"I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]

## L5.T23 Get Planet Name By ID (debug)

The function is not returning the correct values. Can you figure out why?

Example (Input --> Output ):

3 --> "Earth"

## L5.T24 Cat years, Dog years

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that
